# Latch-Up Test Procedure

This procedure automates latch-up validation using two pattern states: `inputs_low` and `inputs_high`.

## Steps

1. Run initialization pattern
2. Measure IDD/VDD before pulsing
3. Inject current pulse (positive/negative)
4. Measure IDD/VDD again
5. Apply judgement logic
6. Log results
7. Repeat for all pins and both patterns
